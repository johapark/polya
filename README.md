This repository provides codes for reproducing some key results from the manuscript titled "Short poly(A) tails are protected from deadenylation by the LARP1-PABP complex"

Creating a new conda environment is recommended to run the codes in jupyter notebooks. 

```conda create -n polya python=3.7 jupyterlab```

You should activate the conda environment before installing Python packages.

```conda activate polya``` 

The following command will install the `polya` package and other requirements. 

```pip install -e .```
